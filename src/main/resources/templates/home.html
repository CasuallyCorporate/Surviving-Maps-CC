        This project has been started to provide the community with a tool to find Landing Sites for missions on
        Surviving Mars.
        At the moment, this is a work-in progress, but please feel free to suggest features/improvements on <a
            href="https://github.com/CasuallyCorporate/Surviving-Maps-CC/discussions">the GitHub discussions page</a>. However, this is a hobby project and
        other things come first.
    </p>
    <p>
        Change notes and contributions are updated in the <a th:href="@{about}">About/Versions</a> page, as well as on github.
